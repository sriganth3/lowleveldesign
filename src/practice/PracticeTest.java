		 * Problem Statement:
		 * You are tasked with designing a vehicle production system for a large automobile manufacturer. 
		 * The system needs to create different types of vehicles (Car, Bike, MotorCycle) without changing 
		 * the core production logic. The system should allow for easy extension to produce new types of 
		 * vehicles in the future.
		 * 
		 * The vehicle creation process should be abstracted so that client code doesn't need to know 
		 * which specific vehicle class it is dealing with, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
		 * 
		 * Objective:
		 * Use the Factory Method Pattern to create different vehicle types by utilizing their respective 
		 * factories, while keeping the client code unaware of the specific implementations.
